        <!-- Market Overview -->
        <section>
            <h2>Market Overview</h2>
            <p>KCH26 March 2026 contract closed slightly higher this week at 381.20 cents, supported by Brazil's persistent dry weather and the sharp decline in ICE certified stocks. ICE monitored Arabica stocks fell to 398,645 bags, a 1.75-year low, while Robusta stocks remained at 4,911 lots, their lowest level in 6.25 months.</p>
            
            <p>The Trump administration announced on November 21 that it would withdraw the 40% tariff on Brazilian coffee, with the measure retroactively applied to November 13, allowing for refunds of previously paid duties. However, concerns about increased global coffee supply have emerged as the EU Parliament approved a one-year delay in EUDR (Deforestation Regulation) implementation.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Key Issue</h3>
                <p><strong>Brazil Dry Weather Continues:</strong> Minas Gerais recorded only 26.4mm of rainfall in the week ending November 21, just 49% of the historical average, raising concerns about the 2026/27 crop.</p>

            <h3>Technical Analysis</h3>
            <p>KCH26 is consolidating in the 377-385 cent range. It found support near the lower Bollinger Band on both 4-hour and daily charts, confirming 377 as short-term support. Key resistance is at 390 cents, with support at the 375-377 cent range.</p>

            <p>Robusta fell to its lowest level since late September, and recovery above 4350 will determine future direction.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Origin Updates</h2>

            <h3>Brazil 🇧🇷</h3>
            <p><strong>Crop & Weather:</strong> Weekly rainfall in Minas Gerais ending November 21 was 26.4mm, only 49% of normal levels, as dry conditions persist. Most of Minas Gerais received no rain from early April through late September, causing "stress flowering" due to severe tree stress.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Production Outlook:</strong> StoneX forecasts Brazil's total 2026/27 coffee production at 70.7 million bags (including 47.2 million Arabica), a 29% increase from the previous year.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Currency:</strong> The Brazilian Real hit a one-week high against the dollar, which suppressed export sales from Brazilian producers.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>🔬 Structural Change: Brazil Robusta Production Surge</h3>
                <p>According to Bloomberg analysis, Brazil's Robusta production has <strong>increased over 81% in the past decade</strong>. As traditional Arabica growing regions face severe droughts and high temperatures due to climate change, farmers are transitioning to Robusta varieties that are more heat-tolerant and disease-resistant.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12px;">StoneX coffee market analysis manager Fernando Maximiliano noted that "climate issues and Arabica losses, rather than increased demand, have been the main drivers of Robusta growth." This represents a strategic variety shift as Brazil works to maintain its position as the world's largest coffee supplier.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Vietnam 🇻🇳</h3>
            <p><strong>Export Performance:</strong> Vietnam exported 1.3 million tons of coffee through October, earning $7.41 billion, up 61.8% year-over-year. Vicofa cited high-quality processing and market expansion as growth drivers.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Production Outlook:</strong> Vietnam's 2025/26 coffee production is expected to reach 1.76 million tons (29.4 million bags), a 4-year high and 6% increase from the previous year.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Weather:</strong> Heavy rain is forecast for Dak Lak province, Vietnam's largest coffee-growing region, which is expected to further delay harvest.</p>

            <h3>Colombia 🇨🇴</h3>
            <p>US tariffs on Colombian coffee remain at 10%, relatively low compared to Brazil (50%) and Vietnam (20%). As the world's second-largest Arabica producer, Colombia is in a favorable position given Brazil's supply disruptions.</p>

                <p>According to Bloomberg reporting, climate change is causing <strong>structural shifts in global coffee market variety composition</strong>. While the milder-tasting Arabica has traditionally dominated premium markets, deteriorating growing conditions are accelerating the shift to heat-resistant Robusta.</p>

            <h3>2. Changing Consumer Trends</h3>
            <p>According to Euromonitor International's Matthew Barry, Global Insights Manager, <strong>younger consumers are less interested in coffee origin or roasting methods</strong>. They prefer customized beverages with milk, creamers, and syrups, which mask the original bean flavor.</p>
            
            <p>This creates an environment where Robusta's bitterness becomes less important, and as coffee prices continue to rise, <strong>consumers are increasingly likely to shift to more affordable Robusta-based products</strong>.</p>

                    <span class="opportunity-title">Robusta Blending Expansion</span>
                    <p>There is room for increased Robusta content in RTD (Ready-to-Drink) and instant coffee markets. Utilization is expected to increase particularly in value-oriented product lines targeting younger consumers.</p>

                    <span class="opportunity-title">Extended Brazil Dry Weather</span>
                    <p>If La Niña extends dry conditions through February 2026, the 2026/27 crop faces serious damage. Water shortage during flowering directly impacts harvest volumes.</p>

                    <span class="opportunity-title">Further ICE Stock Decline</span>
                    <p>If stocks fall from current 398,645 bags to below 350,000, supply shortage concerns intensify. Potential depletion of 131,000 bags of Mexican origin.</p>

                    <p>With Vietnam exports up 61.8% in Jan-Oct 2025 and a 4-year production high forecast, Robusta supply increase could expand Arabica substitution demand.</p>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    <span class="risk-title">Tariff Removal Effects</span>
                    <p>With 40% Brazil tariffs removed, US imports are expected to normalize. Retroactive application to Nov 13 and potential refunds increase supply factors.</p>
